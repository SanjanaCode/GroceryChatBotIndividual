# Further Concerns

## Implementation

The further concerns class has one principal method: concernsHandler() which deals with questions that are not about store or product information. For example, the concernsHandler deals with questions about returns and refunds.
To deal with other concerns of the user, the chatbot provides 3 options:

1. First the chatbot asks if the user would like to visit the store. If user responds yes, the bot provides the store address.

2. If user responds no to the above question, then the bot asks if user would like to be contacted by a human agent. If user responds yes to this question, the bot collects the user's phone number and a brief description of their concern. The bot also informs the user that the human agent will get back to them within 24 hours.

3. Finally, if the user responds no to both of the above questions, then the bot provides the user with the customer service number so that the user can contact the customer service at their own convenience.
